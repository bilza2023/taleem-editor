## ✏️ Editor — Create Structured Lessons

![Editor Screenshot](docs/assets/editor.png)

The Editor is where lessons are created.

It is designed to be calm, structured, and focused.

### 🧰 Toolbar Overview

The toolbar allows you to:

• ➕ Create a new lesson  
• 📝 Add different slide types  
• 🖼️ Insert images  
• 📐 Add equations  
• 🎯 Control slide timing  
• 🎵 Attach sound (optional)  
• 💾 Save your lesson file  

Each slide type has a clear purpose — titles, text, image-based explanations, comparison layouts, and structured reasoning slides.

Slides are built step by step.  
You control the order.  
You control the pacing.  

When finished, simply save your lesson as a file.

## ▶️ Player — Present with Clarity

The Player is built for calm, controlled presentation.

### 🎬 How It Works

• 📂 Open your saved lesson file  
• ▶️ Press play  
• ⏸ Pause when needed  
• ⏹ Stop and restart  
• 🎚 Use the timeline to control progress  

Content appears in structured steps — not all at once.  
This allows teachers to explain clearly and students to follow comfortably.

The Player keeps focus on learning — not on interface complexity.
